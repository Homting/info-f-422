## Getting ready with R notebooks

The use of the notebook requires to install:

* Jupyter Notebooks, see installation instructions [here](http://jupyter.org/install.html). The simplest way is to rely on Anaconda. The `jupyter` program is in the `bin`folder of anaconda. Add the folder to your PATH. 
* The IRkernel, see installation instructions [here](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel).

Once installed, you can start jupyter notebook with the command

```
jupyter notebook
```

from the terminal.
